<p>One Maths is an online maths learning website aimed at providing top
quality tuition to UK students aged 11-18, helping students achieve exam
success with minimum effort.</p>

<h3 id="label-Contractor-2FContributor+Sought">Contractor/Contributor Sought</h3>

<p>We are currently looking for a contractor to carry out some of the below
(and more) development work for us. This is a paid position, pay depend on
experience and can negotiate. The contracting work can possibly lead to a
permanent role in our startup. We are currently a team of 3, and have
secured funding for 2 years for a team of 4. If you are interested, please
drop me an email: chn_challenger@hotmail.com</p>
<hr>

<h3 id="label-Outline">Outline</h3>

<p>Tuition is delivered via videos, which are voiced over latex maths
presentations, uniform quality and meticulously prepared. Students are
asked to practice with exercise questions in order to achieve passing
experience in individual lessons, and higher levels across the topic as a
whole. Our questions are designed in two groups. The first group are lesson
practice questions, which exhibit a high level of association with the
lesson video examples learnt. Students should be able to complete these
questions with relative ease due to the high similarity to the lesson
examples. Full solution to a question is provided after student answered a
question, using methods outlined in the video example. Students should not
struggle with this first group of practice questions, they are here to help
reinforce the basic ideas. The second group of questions are more
challenging, these are placed at the end of each chapter. This is where the
student is increasingly challenged, less structure is given, more abstract
use of the ideas are demanded. In this second group, very detailed
solutions are also provided upon completion of a question, thus allowing
the student to understand at least one way in which the problem can be
solved.</p>

<p>We are developing features to foster good habits for our students, and
gamification features to keep them interested enough to complete the
courses. Currently implemented is a streak bonus system, students are
encouraged to slow down and get things right the first time. Each time a
student completes a question successfully, streak-bonus is added for the
next question in the lesson/chapter, which is a percentage of the question
experience. This can increase to a maximum of 100% after 5 consecutive
correct answers. The streak bonus is reset to 0 in event of a wrong
solution. We would like to also add a daily experience bonus to encourage
students to do questions everyday, as well as many other gamification
features to motivate students.</p>

<p>Eventually, our website should be an overpowered tutor replacement for vast
majority of students who are looking for maths tuition outside of school.
We have yet to decide on a business model, one possibility is to offer
subscription, together with 100% money back guarantee for minimum exam
success, provided student completes our courses.</p>

<h3 id="label-Development+Installation">Development Installation</h3>

<p>Anyone interested in our project is welcome to download and play with our
code. To install for local development, need to</p>

<p>Google the installations for these.</p>

<h5 id="label-Step+3-3A+Create+the+databases+and+run+migrations">Step 3: Create the databases and run migrations</h5>

<p>Inside the project root directory, create the dev and test databases
<code>sh rake db:create </code> Run migrations <code>sh rake db:migrate
rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test </code></p>

<h5 id="label-Step+4-3A+Start+local+server">Step 4: Start local server</h5>

<p>Inside the project root directory, create the dev and test databases
<code>sh rails s </code> Visit localhost in chrome <code>sh
http://localhost:3000 </code></p>

<h5 id="label-Create+an+admin+user+who+can+add+content">Create an admin user who can add content</h5>

<p>Visit localhost in chrome, Sign up as a new user, then start the rails
console <code>sh rails c </code> Find the last user (your user) <code>sh
admin = User.last </code> Set role to &#39;super_admin&#39; <code>sh
admin.role = &#39;super_admin&#39; admin.save </code> Now you can create
course and other content while logged on as this user.</p>

<h5 id="label-Create+an+student+user">Create an student user</h5>

<p>By default, all new users are assigned role of &#39;student&#39;.</p>

<h5 id="label-Create+questions+-2F+question+choice+with+image">Create questions / question choice with image</h5>

<p>You will need to either link the development app to your own AWS S3 account
or remove the AWS gem so that the images are saved locally.</p>

absent for 7 days.  These bonus points are added/used on a 1 to 1 basis whenever they next gain
experience normally by answering questions correctly next time they are online.</code></pre>
